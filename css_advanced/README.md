# CSS Advanced – ALX Frontend Project

Welcome to the **CSS Advanced** project — a continuation of the ALX Frontend curriculum. In this project, I bring together HTML structure and professional CSS styling to recreate a fully responsive, visually polished webpage based on a Figma design file.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Implement a web page from a Figma design using HTML and CSS
- Apply semantic HTML structure to improve accessibility and readability
- Use CSS Flexbox to build responsive layouts
- Style text, images, buttons, and other elements to match the design
- Ensure mobile responsiveness using media queries and the `viewport` meta tag

## 🎨 Design Source

- Figma design provided by ALX
- Fonts used:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/otto-maurer-design/spin-cycle)
  - Design values (like padding, width, font size) were sometimes in floats — rounded when necessary
